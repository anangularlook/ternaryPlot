# ternaryPlot

This repository is the code associated with the ternary plot project on AnAngularLook; a blog by Russel Madere to discuss data visualization on the web using AngularJS. This project is an AngularJS only attempt to create a ternary plot. This project will be followed by attempts to create the same plot with other Open Source, JavaScript, visualization libraries like d3. If one library stands out beyond the rest, a charting module for AngularJS will be built through the blog using that library.
